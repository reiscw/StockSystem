# StockSystem
An application used to automatically re-balance stock and mutual fund portfolios

This is a simple application used to create and rebalance Stock/ETF/Mutual Fund Portfolio portfolios. Portfolio information is saved in a simple text file, and the program uses code provided in the (sstrickx / yahoofinance-api) and (qos-ch / slf4j) GitHub repositories to provide stock price data.

The code is stored in such a way that it can be imported as an Eclipse project using Maven to update the dependencies.

The program has been used most extensively on macOS (v12.4) but also works well on Windows and Linux operating systems.
