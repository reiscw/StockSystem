# StockSystem
An application used to automatically re-balance stock and mutual fund portfolios

This is a simple application used to create and rebalance Stock/ETF/Mutual Fund Portfolio portfolios. Portfolio information is saved in a simple text file; Position objects are able to update their prices dynamically using Yahoo Finance data.

On most systems (Linux/MacOS) giving executable permissions to buildStockSystem and executing it will create a JAR file. On Windows, buildStockSystem can be modified to a .BAT file for the same purpose.

The program has been used most extensively on macOS (v12.4+) but also works well on Windows and Linux operating systems.
